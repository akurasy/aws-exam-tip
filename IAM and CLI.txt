iam is used to create users account in an organisation.

users can be added to a group
group cannot be added to another group

users can belong to multiple groups

IAM PERMISSIONS
Users or groupsare assigned permission in JSON documents called policies

the policy defines the permission of the users or groups

in AWS you apply the LEAST privilege principle: don't give more permissions than a user needs

group policy === attached to a group
inline policy === attached to a user


SECURING YOUR ACCT
password security policy to protect your acct
MFA is a multi-factor authenticator to secure your acct. an hacker might have access to your root acct password but will not be able to login without the MFA.

MFA = password you know + device you own.
examples
google authy = phone only
authy = multi device
universal 2nd factor (U2F) E.G Yubikey. === this is a hard device and a third part device 
hardware key Fob MFA for AWS Govcloud (US) === 3rd party




ACCESSING AWS
using the aws management console providing password and MFA
using the CLI console using access key and secret key
aws sdk protected by access key embedded with your application

IAM SECURITY TOOLS


IAM Credentials Report  (Account Level) :  A REPORT that lists all your account users and the status of their various credentials.

IAM Access Advisor (User Level): it shows the access granted to a user and when last those services were last accessed.

IAM GUIDELINES AND BEST PRACTICES
- Do not use your root account except when setting up your aws account.
- One Physical user = One AWS user (do not share one single account between two users).
- assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
- create a strong password policy
- use MFA
- Create roles for giving permissions to AWS services
- create access key for programmatic access.
- AUDIT the pernmission of your account using IAM credential report or IAM access advisor.


IAM SUMMARY
iam users mapped to physical users
policy: JSON document map out permission for groups and users
security = MFA + PASSWORD
AWS CLI: manage your aws services via the command line interface
AWS SDK: manage your aws services via the programmatic language
access key: access both AWS CLI and AWS SDK
audit: iam credentail access for users & credentials, and iam access advisor for access granted to users.
