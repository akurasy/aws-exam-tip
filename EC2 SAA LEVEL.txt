PRIVATE VS PUBLIC VS ELASTIC IP
PUBLIC IP:
means the machine can be accessible on the internet
must be unique. no two mcahines can have the same public IP
can be geo-located easily.

PRIVATE IP:
means the machine can only be identified on a private network only.
the IP must be unique accross the private network
two different private network conpanies can have the same private IP
machines connect to www using NAT and IGW (a proxy).
only a specified range of IP can be used as private IP.


ELASTIC IP:
when you stop and start an instance, it will change its public IP
Elastic IP enables you to retain your public IP
Its an elastic IPv4
you can only have a max of 5 elastic IP per account. (you can ask aws for more)
its allows you to mask instance failure to another instance in your account
they often reflect poor architecture.

EC2 PLACEMENT GROUPS
This is the strategy used to have control over your EC2 placement

when you create a placement group, you specify one of the following strategies:
cluster: clusters instances into a low latency group in a single AZ
spread: spreads the instances accross underlying hardware (max 7 instances per group per AZ). critical applications
partition: this is similar to spread. it spreads instances accross across many different partitions. 
(which rely on diff set of racks) within an AZ. Scale to 100s of EC2 instances per group.


CLUSTER
pros: great network
cons: if rack fails all instances fail at the same time
usecase:
big data job that needs to complete very fast
application that needs low latency and high network throughput.

SPREAD
pros: can spread accross multiple AZ, reduced risk is simultaneous failure
cons: we are limited to 7 AZ per placement group.
usecase:
application that requires high availabilty
critical instance where each instance can be isolated from failure from each other.


PARTTION
up to 7 partitions per AZ. each partition is regarded as a rack, span multiple AZ, 100s of EC2 instance, each partition is isolated from failure.
usecase:
casandra, HDFS, HBase, Kafka 
 



========================================================


ELASTIC NETWORK INTERFACE
Logical components in a VPC  that represents a virtual network card. they are what gives EC2 instances access to the network.
they are used outside EC2 instances as well.

ENI IS USED TO REDUCE NETWORK FAILOVER.

each ENI has the following attributes:
1. each ENI HAVE one primary private IPv4, one or more secondary private IPv4
2. one elastic IP (IPv4) per private IP
3. one public IPV4
4. one or more SG
5. BOUND to a specific AZ.


==========================================================


EC2 HIBERNATE
preffered than ec2 stop instance. memory can be quickly retrived because your OS is not stopped

Things to know about EC2 hibernate:
-	supported instance familty === C3,C4,C5,I3,M3,M4,R3,R4,T2,T3......
-	Instance RAM= must be less than 150GB
-	instance type= not supported for bare metal instances
-	root volume= must be EBS, encrypted, not instance store and large
-	available on-demand, reserved and spot instances.
-	instances cannot be hibernated more than 60days.
