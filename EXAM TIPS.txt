It's designed to provide massively parallel shared access to thousands of Amazon EC2 instances, enabling applications to achieve high levels of aggregate throughput
and IOPS with consistent low latencies. 
As EFS uses the NFS protocol, it can be used by NFS clients, satisfying the organization's requirement for a fully managed solution with NFS client capability.

- A NAT gateway enables instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet but prevents the internet from initiating a connection with those instances

- A multivalue answer routing policy in Amazon Route 53 is used to route traffic approximately randomly to multiple resources, such as EC2 instance
The Multivalue Answer Routing Policy lets you have Route 53 respond to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records selected at random.
it returns all the IP addresses of healthy instances when a DNS query is made.

- VPC peering allows for private, secure communication between two VPCs

- IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles are a secure way to grant permissions to entities that you trust, such as AWS services, 
applications running on EC2, or even users in another AWS account. Roles avoid the need to share and manage long-term credentials, thus enhancing security.

- when launching an instance during the add storage option, uncheck the delete on termination or set it to NO , to avoid volume deletion when an instance is terminated.

- Amazon Aurora is a MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database built for the cloud that combines the performance and availability of traditional enterprise 
databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open source databases.
It provides superior fault tolerance by spreading replicas across multiple Availability Zones, which can greatly enhance the availability of the platform.

It continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations. With Config, you can review changes in configurations and relationships between AWS resources, 
dive into detailed resource configuration histories, and determine your overall compliance against the configurations specified in your internal guidelines.

- Amazon RDS Proxy is a fully managed, highly available database proxy for Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) that makes applications more scalable,
 more resilient to database failures, and more secure. It allows applications to pool and share database connections,
 reducing the overhead of establishing new connections and relieving the pressure on the database, which can significantly improve application scalability and latency.

- ALB  conducts health checks on these instances and only routes traffic to healthy ones. 
Therefore, if you create an ALB with a health check in front of the EC2 instances and configure Amazon Route 53 to route traffic to the ALB, 
it ensures that users are routed only to healthy instances, eliminating the access failures

- When NAT instances that are not able to support the application's traffic requirements. The solutions architect needs to provision a NAT gateway
 that ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and automatic scalability.

- when a dynamodb has lower efficiency, increasing the provisioned throughput on the new global secondary index (GSI) might improve performance.
 it's recommended to complete any large-scale operations before adding a GSI to prevent further performance degradation during its creation.

Amazon API Gateway is an AWS service for creating, deploying, and managing APIs. It can handle any volume of incoming data
and can effectively channel this raw data to an Amazon Kinesis data stream. Kinesis Data Streams can collect and process large streams of data records in real-time
and store to S3. the data is picked from S3 by aws glue for analytic purpose.

- AWS Secrets Manager protects access to applications, services, and IT resources. This service enables you to easily rotate, manage, and retrieve database credentials, 
API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycle.

- AWS Backup is a fully managed backup service that makes it easy to centralize and automate the back up of data across AWS services. AWS Backup provides the 
ability to create backup plans that automate the backup scheduling, lifecycle management, and backup retention. the backup can have an exptration period
due to the organization's retention policy.

- Amazon RDS does not support enabling encryption for an existing DB instance directly. However, you can create a snapshot of your existing database,
 which is an exact copy of the database at the time the snapshot was taken. Then you can create a copy of this snapshot but this time,
 you will have the option to enable encryption. The process is simple, you select the snapshot you created, copy it, 
and then choose an encryption key while creating the copy.


- AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that enables your on-premises applications to seamlessly use AWS cloud storage. 
It offers file-based, volume-based, and tape-based storage solutions.

that can be used for secure network communications and to establish the identity of websites over the Internet.
By attaching an ACM certificate to the Application Load Balancer (ALB), all data in transit between the ALB and the clients will be encrypted

- AWS Global Accelerator improves the availability and performance of your applications by using the AWS global network. 
It provides static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your applications and routes user traffic to the optimal AWS endpoint 
based on several factors like geographic proximity, health of the endpoint, and user-configurable routing policies accross multiple regions.


- Amazon ECS is a highly scalable and high-performance container orchestration service that supports Docker containers.
 It allows you to run and manage your Docker containerized applications without having to install and operate your own container orchestration software
 or manage the underlying infrastructure. 
Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate removes the need to provision and manage servers and lets you specify and pay for resources per application,
 which is great for a company looking to focus on the application rather than the infrastructure. By specifying a minimum of 2 tasks, 
the application can enjoy high availability and fault tolerance, important characteristics for any complex web application.


- global accelerator is good for a blue-green deployment to release various versions of an application.

It also supports IAM authentication.

- AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run your code without provisioning or managing servers.
 It executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second. 
This makes it incredibly useful for workloads that are sporadic or unpredictable. it is also cost-effective.

- configuring S3 life cycle policy to delete the previous and current version of an object deletes the object completely.

- enabling default encryption settings on the S3 bucket ensures that all new objects added to the bucket will automatically be encrypted. 
For existing objects, AWS offers a feature called S3 Inventory, which can create a list (.csv file) of all objects in the bucket, 
including their encryption status. This is a simple, automated way to identify all unencrypted objects without needing to manually search through the bucket.

Next, to encrypt these existing unencrypted objects, the best tool is S3 Batch Operations. 
This feature allows you to perform large-scale operations on S3 objects, such as copying, 
which in this case can be used to apply encryption. By using the copy command with encryption settings, 
you can effectively apply encryption to all identified unencrypted objects.

- When you use Amazon RDS Read Replicas, you are charged for data transfer from the primary RDS instance to the read replica. 
If the read replica is in a different region than the primary instance (cross-region replication), then you will incur data transfer costs. 
These costs are based on the amount of data transferred out of the source AWS Region. PLS NOTE THIS IS A REGION BASED CHARGES.

- plls note vpc peering does not have associated SG.

- ACTIVE DIRECTORY DOMAIN SERVICE eliminates the creation of IAM users when linked with amazon FXx luster for windows. memebers or groups who have inherited certain
permissions from  the ADDS for a file can access the file shared when the file is joined with the ADDS.

- AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) protects web applications from common web exploits and attacks. It allows you to define customizable rules to filter 
and monitor incoming web traffic. AWS WAF can be integrated with Amazon CloudFront or Application Load Balancer, providing real-time

but doesn't have an in-built alerting capability.

- PARTITION PLACEMENT GROUPS suitable for distributed and replicated workloads, such as Hadoop, Cassandra, and Kafka.

A cluster placement group is designed to provide low-latency network performance necessary for tightly-coupled node-to-node communication, 
typical of HPC applications. They do not offer the high availability required in this scenario as all instances are created in a single Availability Zone.

Spread placement groups are designed to help reduce the risk of simultaneous failures that might occur when instances share the same racks. 
They are suitable for a small number of critical instances that should be kept separate from each other.
They do not meet the requirement here as they only allow a maximum of seven instances per Availability Zone.

- AWS SCT simplifies heterogeneous database migrations by automatically converting the source database schema to match that of the target database. 
SCT also converts a majority of the custom code, including views, stored procedures, and functions, to match the target database.

from your local data center to the AWS cloud. The devices have high storage capacity, which means you can move a huge volume of data, 
such as the 500 TB in your scenario, without relying on your internet connection.

- AWS Resource Groups helps you organize your AWS resources based on criteria that you define. Specifically, AWS Resource Groups 
and Tag Editor provide a unified view of AWS resources from different AWS services, which can be categorized and managed according to the tags that you assign to them.


- PLS NOTE, WHEN PERFORMING A HEAVY READ AND WRITE OPERATION ON DYNAMODB DATABASE, CREATING A READ REPLICA WILL NOT INCREASE THE THROUGHPUT OF THE OPERATION.
ATTACHING THE DYNAMODB TO AN AUTOSCALING GROUP WILL INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE ARCHITECTURE TO HANDLE THE READ AND WRITE REQUESTS.

- when you see an exam question requesting for a solution to route traffic to an healthy instance. rule out all the options that does not include a listner or a 
listening port to riute traffic traffic to the healthy instance(s)


- Clustered placement - same AZ, instances are similar type. used for high network performance of instances in close promiximity
- partition placement - different AZ . instances can be different types. used for high availability 
- spread placement - instances different partitions. instances can be different. used for fault tolerance.

IF THE PROBLEM IS PERFORMANCE (NETWORK CONNECTIVITY), USE CLUSTER.
IF THE PROBLEM IS AVAILABILITY, USE PARTITION
IF THE PROBLEM IS FAULT TOLERANCE, USE SPREAD

- AWS global accelerator has the capacity of version caching.
